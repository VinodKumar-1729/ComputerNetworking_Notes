- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Range**: 1-5 km.
  - **Cost**: Moderate; often uses a centralized management system.
  - **Transmission Speed**: High.
  
  **Competitive Edge Points**:
  - CANs often employ VLANs (Virtual LANs) for network segmentation and security, allowing efficient data management across different departments.
  - Advanced CANs use hybrid systems (Ethernet for internal connections and fiber optics for inter-building connections) for enhanced speed and reliability.

#### 4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Definition**: MAN spans a city or large campus, covering distances of up to 50 km.
- **Technologies Used**: Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and fiber optics.
- **Applications**: City-wide networks, large university campuses.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Range**: 5-50 km.
  - **Cost**: High; complex setup and maintenance.
  - **Transmission Speed**: Moderate.
  - **Ownership**: Private or Public.
  
  **Competitive Edge Points**:
  - MANs are often used by ISPs for city-wide internet access; dual bus architecture supports high-speed bidirectional data flow.
  - MANs allow centralized management, making them ideal for city-wide monitoring systems or transport networks.

#### 5. Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Definition**: WAN connects devices over large geographical distances, such as between cities or countries.
- **Technologies Used**: Leased lines, dial-up, and satellite.
- **Applications**: The Internet, corporate networks.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Range**: Above 50 km.
  - **Cost**: Very high; requires dedicated infrastructure and high maintenance.
  - **Transmission Speed**: Low to moderate.
  - **Ownership**: Typically public, but private WANs exist for businesses.
  
  **Competitive Edge Points**:
  - WANs use redundancy and load balancing to enhance reliability.
  - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are often deployed on WANs to provide secure remote access.

### Internetworking
- **Definition**: Internetworking is the process of connecting multiple computer networks (such as LANs and WANs) using intermediary devices like routers.
- **Types of Internetworks**:
  - **Intranet**: A private network accessible only within an organization, enhancing internal communication.
  - **Extranet**: An extension of an intranet that grants limited access to external partners, clients, or stakeholders.
  - **Internet**: A global network that interconnects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.

  **Competitive Edge Points**:
  - **Intranet Security**: Intranets offer secure information sharing within organizations, usually protected by firewalls.
  - **VPN Use in Extranet**: Extranets often use VPNs to safely extend network access to external entities.
