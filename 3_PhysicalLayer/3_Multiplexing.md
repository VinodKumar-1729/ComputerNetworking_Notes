### Multiplexing in Computer Networks

**Definition:**
Multiplexing is the process of combining multiple signals from various sources and transmitting them over a single communication or physical line. It is facilitated by devices like the multiplexer (MUX) and demultiplexer (DEMUX).

- **MUX (Multiplexer):** Takes ‘n’ input lines and generates a single output line.
- **DEMUX (Demultiplexer):** Takes a single input line and generates ‘n’ output lines.

### Why Multiplexing?

- **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of physical connections required, minimizing cost and complexity.
- **Resource Sharing:** Enables multiple devices to share a single communication link.
- **Bandwidth Utilization:** Allows optimal use of available bandwidth by allocating resources dynamically.

**Alternative Approach:** A direct point-to-point connection requires:
1. An I/O port for each device.
2. A separate physical line for each device.
3. Extensive wiring, especially in geographically distributed systems.

**Advantages of Multiplexing Approach:**
- Reduces hardware requirements.
- Simplifies network architecture.
- Allows dynamic allocation of bandwidth.

### Types of Multiplexing in Computer Networks

1. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Divides the frequency spectrum into distinct frequency bands, each allocated to a logical channel.
   - **Process:** Signals are modulated onto different carrier frequencies, separated by guard bands.
   - **Applications:** Analog transmission, cable television.

   **Advantages:**
   - Simple modulation and demodulation process.
   - Simultaneous signal transmission.

   **Disadvantages:**
   - Inefficient bandwidth usage.
   - Susceptibility to interference and noise.

2. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Allocates the entire bandwidth to each user for a short burst of time.
   - **Process:** Uses time slots to share the transmission medium.
   - **Applications:** Digital communication, telecommunication.

   **Types of TDM:**
   - **Synchronous TDM:** Fixed time slots for devices, regardless of activity.
   - **Statistical TDM:** Allocates slots dynamically based on demand.
   - **Asynchronous TDM:** Does not rely on a global clock, adapts to varying rates.
   - **Interleaving TDM:** High-speed switching between MUX and DEMUX.

   **Advantages:**
   - Optimal use of channel resources.
   - Suitable for digital communication.

   **Disadvantages:**
   - Idle slots waste bandwidth if a device is inactive.

3. **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Similar to FDM but operates in the optical frequency range.
   - **Process:** Combines multiple data streams onto a single fiber optic cable.
   - **Applications:** Fiber optic communications, high-speed internet.

   **Types of WDM:**
   - **Dense WDM (DWDM):** Supports many channels, high capacity.
   - **Coarse WDM (CWDM):** Fewer channels, cost-effective.

   **Advantages:**
   - High reliability and capacity.
   - Independent signal rates.

### Additional Types of Multiplexing

1. **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Assigns unique codes to each signal, allowing simultaneous transmission.
   - **Applications:** Mobile communication, radio communication.
   
   **Advantages:**
   - Enhanced data security.
   - Efficient spectrum usage.

2. **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Digital communication technique using orthogonal carriers.
   - **Applications:** Digital radio, satellite communication.

3. **Space Division Multiplexing (SDM):**
   - **Mechanism:** Combines FDM and TDM; assigns channels to specific spatial locations.
   - **Applications:** Passive Optical Networks (PON).

   **Advantages:**
   - High data transmission rate.
   - Suitable for large-scale networks.

### Disadvantages of Multiplexing
- **Complexity:** Increases system design complexity.
- **Single Point of Failure (SPoF):** Failure in the MUX or DEMUX disrupts the entire system.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Limited fault tolerance mechanisms.
