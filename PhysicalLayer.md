### **Physical Layer (Computer Networks)**

#### **Introduction**
- The **Physical Layer** is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model, focusing on the transmission and reception of raw, unstructured data streams across a physical medium.
- It deals with the **mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural characteristics** to activate, maintain, and deactivate physical links.

### **Functions of the Physical Layer**
1. **Data Rate Management**:
   - Regulates the rate of bit transmission.
   - Determines **bandwidth utilization** and synchronization.

2. **Synchronization**:
   - Ensures that the sender and receiver are synchronized for accurate data interpretation.
   - Uses mechanisms like **clock recovery** and **bit stuffing**.

3. **Transmission Medium Selection**:
   - Decides the direction (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex).
   - Selects between guided media (e.g., cables) and unguided media (e.g., radio waves).

4. **Physical Topology**:
   - Determines **network topology** such as mesh, star, bus, or ring.
   - Influences network performance, redundancy, and cost.

5. **Line Configuration**:
   - **Point-to-Point**: Dedicated link between two devices.
   - **Multi-Point**: Shared link among multiple devices.

6. **Physical Medium and Interface**:
   - Defines connectors, pin configurations, and voltage levels.
   - Uses interfaces like **RS-232, RS-485, and USB standards**.

7. **Switching**:
   - Manages data switching mechanisms for forwarding packets efficiently.

8. **Error Detection at Signal Level**:
   - Identifies errors due to attenuation, noise, or signal interference.

9. **Modulation**:
   - Converts digital signals into analog for transmission over certain mediums (e.g., **ASK, FSK, PSK, QAM**).

### **Transmission Mediums**
#### **Modes**:
1. **Simplex**:
   - One-way communication (e.g., TV broadcasting).
2. **Half-Duplex**:
   - Two-way, but not simultaneous (e.g., walkie-talkies).
3. **Full Duplex**:
   - Simultaneous two-way communication (e.g., telephones).

### **Physical Topologies**
| **Topology**   | **Key Points**                                                                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mesh**       | High security, no data collision; difficult and expensive to install.                                    |
| **Star**       | Central hub failure causes the network to fail.                                                          |
| **Bus**        | Uses a single backbone cable; prone to bottlenecks and collisions.                                       |
| **Ring**       | Token-based access prevents collision; entire network fails if one node is down without redundancy.      |

### **Key Protocols and Technologies**
1. **Ethernet Variants**:
   - **100BaseT**: Fast Ethernet using twisted-pair cables.
   - **1000Base-SX**: Fiber-optic transmission.
   - **1000Base-T**: Gigabit Ethernet using copper cables.

2. **Wireless Standards**:
   - Physical-layer specifications for **802.11** (Wi-Fi).
   - **Bluetooth**: Short-range communication standard.

3. **Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET/SDH)**:
   - Transmits large volumes of data over optical fiber.

4. **Controller Area Network (CAN)**:
   - Used in embedded systems, especially automotive applications.

### **Underrated/Additional Key Points**
1. **Baseband and Broadband Transmission**:
   - **Baseband**: Uses the entire bandwidth for a single signal.
   - **Broadband**: Multiple signals share the same medium.

2. **Electrical Signal Characteristics**:
   - Signal parameters: **Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase**.
   - Impact of noise types: **Thermal noise, Crosstalk, and Impulse noise**.

3. **Data Encoding Techniques**:
   - Examples: **NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)**, **Manchester Encoding**, and **4B/5B Encoding**.
   - Manchester encoding aids synchronization by combining clock and data signals.

4. **Physical Layer Devices**:
   - **Hubs**: Operate entirely on Layer 1.
   - **Repeaters**: Boost weak signals to cover longer distances.

5. **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)**:
   - Transmits multiple signals on a single fiber-optic cable by using different wavelengths.

6. **Signal Propagation Issues**:
   - **Attenuation**: Signal weakens over distance.
   - **Reflection and Refraction**: Impact optical signals in fiber optics.
   - **Dispersion**: Causes spreading of light signals, reducing clarity.

7. **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**:
   - Converts analog signals into digital for efficient transmission.
