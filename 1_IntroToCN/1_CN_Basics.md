### Computer Networking

#### Definition
Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices to share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other. It involves hardware (e.g., routers, switches, cables) and software (e.g., protocols, applications) to enable communication over various media, such as wired or wireless connections.

### Key Terms

1. **Node**:
   - Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or server.
   - Example: A laptop accessing a Wi-Fi network is a node.

2. **Host**:
   - A node that can communicate directly with other nodes and often has a unique IP address.
   - Example: A web server hosting a website.

3. **Link**:
   - A physical or logical connection between two or more nodes in a network.
   - Types: Wired (Ethernet) and Wireless (Wi-Fi).

4. **Path**:
   - The route taken by data to travel from the source node to the destination node in a network.
   - Example: Routing algorithms determine the shortest path.

5. **Packet**:
   - The smallest unit of data transmitted over a network.
   - Consists of a header (with addressing information) and payload (actual data).

6. **Frame**:
   - A data packet at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model).
   - Includes error-checking and physical addressing information.

7. **Segment**:
   - A data unit at the Transport Layer (Layer 4 of the OSI model).
   - Example: TCP segments include sequence numbers for proper data reassembly.

8. **Message**:
   - A complete set of data or communication sent from a source to a destination.
   - Example: An email or an HTTP request.

9. **Bandwidth**:
   - The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network link in a given period, usually measured in bits per second (bps).
   - Example: A 100 Mbps link can transfer up to 100 megabits of data per second.

### Protocols and Standards

#### Protocols
Protocols are predefined rules and conventions that devices follow to communicate effectively within a network.
- **Examples**:
  - HTTP/HTTPS: For web communication.
  - FTP: For file transfers.
  - TCP/IP: For data transmission.
  - DNS: For translating domain names into IP addresses.

#### Standards
Standards ensure interoperability and compatibility among different hardware and software systems.

- **Examples**:
  - Ethernet (IEEE 802.3): For wired local area networks.
  - Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): For wireless local area networks.
  - IPv4/IPv6: For Internet addressing.

### Standard Organizations

1. **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**:
   - Develops networking and communication standards, such as IEEE 802 (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
   - Key Role: Defines protocols and physical standards for network communication.

2. **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**:
   - Develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, especially related to TCP/IP.
   - Produces Request for Comments (RFC) documents that outline technical standards.

3. **ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector)**:
   - Focuses on international telecommunication standards, including networking protocols like G.711 for audio compression.

4. **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**:
   - Manages the global Domain Name System (DNS) and IP address allocation.
   - Ensures a stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifiers.

5. **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**:
   - Develops web standards, including HTML, CSS, and XML.
   - Ensures interoperability and compatibility of web technologies.
