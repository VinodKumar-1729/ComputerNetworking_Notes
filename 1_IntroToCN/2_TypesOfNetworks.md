### **What is a Computer Network?**
A computer network is a system that connects multiple independent computers and devices to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other devices enables efficient communication. Networks can use either cable or wireless media to establish connections. Hardware and software work together to connect devices in a network.

### **Uses of Computer Networks**
- Communicating via email, video conferencing, instant messaging, etc.
- Sharing devices such as printers, scanners, etc.
- Sharing files and data.
- Sharing software and operating systems on remote machines.
- Allowing network users easy access and management of shared information.

### **Types of Computer Networks**
There are five main types of computer networks:
1. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**
2. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
3. **Campus Area Network (CAN)**
4. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
5. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**

**Advantages:**
- High-speed connectivity (10–100 Mbps).
- Centralized management.
- Supports bidirectional data transmission.

**Disadvantages:**
- High setup and maintenance costs.
- Less fault tolerance.
- Complicated design.

---

### **5. Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- **Definition:** A network that connects computers over large geographical areas (>50 km).
- **Technologies Used:** Leased lines, dial-up connections.
- **Examples:** The Internet, global business networks.

**Advantages:**
- Global reach enabling seamless data exchange.
- Centralized data storage and remote access.
- Reduces travel costs for organizations.

**Disadvantages:**
- Low transmission speed compared to LAN and MAN.
- High setup and maintenance costs.
- Prone to noise, errors, and traffic congestion.
