### **1. DNS (Domain Name System)**
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like "example.com") into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network.

**DNS Resolution Process:**
1. **Client Query:** When a user enters a URL in their browser, a DNS query is sent to resolve the domain to an IP address.
2. **Recursive Resolver:** The query first reaches a DNS resolver, which starts the resolution by querying DNS servers on behalf of the client.
3. **Root Server:** If the resolver doesn’t know the IP, it contacts a root server, which directs it to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com, .org).
4. **TLD Server:** The TLD server responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server responsible for the domain.
5. **Authoritative DNS Server:** This server returns the IP address associated with the domain to the resolver.
6. **Caching:** The resolver sends the IP to the client and caches it to respond faster to future requests.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- DNS works on port 53 (UDP for most queries and TCP for zone transfers).
- Types of DNS Records: **A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT,** and **PTR** records.
- **Reverse DNS (PTR Records):** Maps IP addresses back to domain names.
- DNS vulnerabilities include **DNS spoofing** and **DNS amplification attacks**.

#### **2. HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)**
HTTP and HTTPS are protocols for transmitting hypertext (web pages) over the internet.

**How HTTP Works:**
1. **Client Request:** The client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server using methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
2. **Server Response:** The server processes the request and sends an HTTP response with the requested content (web page, image, etc.) or error messages (e.g., 404 Not Found).
3. **Stateless Protocol:** Each request-response cycle is independent, meaning HTTP has no memory of previous interactions unless supported by cookies or sessions.

**HTTPS:**
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data between client and server to prevent interception.
1. **TLS/SSL Encryption:** HTTPS uses SSL/TLS certificates to establish a secure, encrypted connection.
2. **Secure Port 443:** While HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS operates on port 443.
3. **Digital Certificates:** HTTPS requires an SSL/TLS certificate that validates the website’s identity, enhancing trust.

**Key Differences:**
- **Security:** HTTPS is encrypted, while HTTP is not.
- **Use of Certificates:** HTTPS requires SSL/TLS certificates for encryption, HTTP does not.
- **Ports:** HTTP operates on port 80, HTTPS on port 443.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- **HTTP Methods:** Know the purposes of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD.
- **Status Codes:** Familiarize yourself with codes like 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), and 301 (Permanent Redirect).
- HTTPS supports **end-to-end encryption**, protecting data from eavesdropping.

#### **3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and server over the internet.

**Functions of FTP:**
- **File Transfer:** Allows users to upload or download files to/from a remote server.
- **Directory Navigation:** FTP allows users to navigate directories on the remote server.
- **File Management:** Users can create, delete, or move files on the server.

**Security Issues:**
- **Unencrypted Transmission:** FTP transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.
- **Vulnerable Credentials:** Usernames and passwords are also transmitted unencrypted, allowing attackers to capture credentials.
- **Passive Mode Issues:** Passive mode helps with firewalls but can expose the server to additional vulnerabilities.

**Secure Alternatives:**
- **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):** FTP over SSH for secure file transfer.
- **FTPS (FTP Secure):** FTP over TLS/SSL, which encrypts the data but may be less commonly used.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- FTP uses **port 21 for control** and **port 20 for data transfer** (active mode).
- **Active vs. Passive Modes:** In active mode, the client opens a port to receive data; in passive mode, the server opens a port.
- **Security Alternatives:** SFTP and FTPS are essential to know as secure versions of FTP.

### **4. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
SMTP is the protocol used to send emails between servers and from client to server.

**SMTP’s Role in Email Transmission:**
- **Client-to-Server:** When a user sends an email, the client (like Outlook) uses SMTP to transmit the email to the server.
- **Server-to-Server:** SMTP is used to transfer emails between mail servers.
- **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA):** SMTP transfers the message to the MDA, which routes it to the recipient's mailbox.

**Ports and Security:**
- **Ports 25 (Unsecured) and 587 (Secure):** Port 25 is for unencrypted SMTP, while 587 is often used for encrypted connections.
- **Authentication:** SMTP-AUTH is a mechanism to secure SMTP by requiring authentication.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- SMTP operates on **port 25** (unencrypted) and **port 587 or 465** (for encrypted).
- **SMTP Commands:** Know basic commands like HELO, MAIL, RCPT, and DATA.
- SMTP only supports **outgoing mail transfer**, not retrieval.

---

### **5. POP3 and IMAP**
POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) are used to retrieve emails from a mail server.

**POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3):**
- **Simple Retrieval:** Downloads emails to the client and often deletes them from the server.
- **Offline Access:** Allows offline access once emails are downloaded.
- **Storage:** Limited to single device access; emails are stored locally.

**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):**
- **Server Storage:** Keeps emails on the server, allowing access from multiple devices.
- **Synchronization:** Any action (read, delete, move) is synced across devices.
- **Ideal for Webmail:** Provides folder structures and allows selective downloading.

**Key Differences:**
- **POP3** is simpler, downloading emails to a single device and removing them from the server.
- **IMAP** supports multiple devices with server-stored emails, ideal for modern email clients.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- **Ports:** POP3 uses port 110 (unencrypted) and port 995 (encrypted); IMAP uses port 143 (unencrypted) and port 993 (encrypted).
- **Synchronization:** IMAP synchronizes actions across all devices.

### **6. Telnet**
Telnet is an older protocol used to access and manage devices remotely over a network by providing a command-line interface on the remote device.

**Functionality:**
- **Remote Access:** Enables users to execute commands on remote systems as though they are locally present.
- **Plaintext Communication:** Transmits data in unencrypted form, exposing it to potential interception.
- **CLI Access:** Provides direct command-line access to servers, network devices, and other systems.

**Security Concerns:**
- **Unencrypted Transmission:** Since Telnet transmits data in plaintext, both the session and login credentials can be easily intercepted by attackers.
- **Deprecated Use:** Telnet is rarely used today due to its security vulnerabilities; secure alternatives like SSH are preferred.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- Telnet operates on **port 23**.
- **Commands:** Basic commands to know include `open` (to start a connection) and `quit` (to end a session).
- **Limited Use:** Primarily used in internal networks or legacy systems, with SSH as a more secure alternative.

### **7. SSH (Secure Shell)**
SSH is a protocol that provides secure, encrypted remote access to devices, enabling safe data exchange and remote command execution over an unsecured network.

**SSH Features:**
1. **Encryption:** SSH encrypts all data, securing both the session and login credentials.
2. **Authentication Methods:** Supports password-based and public-private key authentication, increasing security.
3. **Tunneling:** Allows for secure tunneling of other protocols (like FTP) through the SSH connection.
4. **Port Forwarding:** SSH can forward traffic securely by encapsulating it, allowing secure communication between devices behind firewalls.

**Security Benefits:**
- **Encryption:** SSH protects against eavesdropping, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, and credential theft.
- **Authentication and Integrity:** Uses public-key cryptography to authenticate users and ensure data integrity.
- **SCP and SFTP:** SSH also provides secure file transfer options through SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

**Important Points for Exam:**
- SSH operates on **port 22**.
- **Key Authentication:** Understand SSH’s use of public-private key pairs for authentication.
- **Commands:** Commands include `ssh` (to initiate a session), `scp` (for secure file transfer), and `exit` (to end a session).

### **8. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
SNMP is a protocol used for monitoring, managing, and configuring network devices. It is commonly used by network administrators to monitor network health and manage devices like routers, switches, servers, and workstations.

**SNMP Components:**
1. **Managed Devices:** Network devices equipped with SNMP-compatible software agents.
2. **SNMP Agent:** Software running on each managed device that collects and communicates data to the network management system (NMS).
3. **Network Management System (NMS):** A centralized system that monitors and controls managed devices using SNMP.

**SNMP Operations:**
- **GET Request:** The NMS retrieves data from an SNMP agent on a managed device.
- **SET Request:** The NMS modifies a parameter on the device.
- **TRAP:** An alert from the agent to the NMS when specific events occur (e.g., device failure).
- **INFORM:** A message similar to a TRAP, but requires acknowledgment from the NMS.

**SNMP Versions:**
- **SNMPv1:** Basic features, lacking security mechanisms.
- **SNMPv2c:** Added bulk transfers and improved performance but still lacks strong security.
- **SNMPv3:** Introduced user-based security with message encryption and authentication.

**Security Concerns:**
- **Data Sensitivity:** SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c lack encryption, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data.
- **SNMPv3 Security:** SNMPv3 supports encryption, integrity, and authentication, significantly improving security.

**Important Points for Exam:**
- **Ports:** SNMP typically uses **port 161** for requests and **port 162** for TRAPs.
- **OID (Object Identifier):** Unique identifiers for each managed object, allowing for granular device monitoring.
- **Community Strings:** In SNMPv1 and v2c, community strings (like passwords) control access to the SNMP agent, with "public" being a default community string—this is a common security risk.
