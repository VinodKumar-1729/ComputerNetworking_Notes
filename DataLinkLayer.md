### **Data Link Layer (Computer Networks) â€“ Modified Notes**

#### **Introduction**
- The **Data Link Layer (DLL)** is the second layer in the OSI model, focusing on **node-to-node delivery** of data.
- It ensures **error-free data transfer** by organizing, encoding, and decoding data into frames.
- The layer hides the underlying hardware complexities, providing seamless communication for higher layers.

### **Sub-Layers of the Data Link Layer**
1. **Logical Link Control (LLC)**:
   - Responsible for:
     - **Multiplexing**: Handles multiple protocols over a single communication medium.
     - **Flow Control**: Prevents buffer overflow.
     - **Error Control**: Provides acknowledgment and retransmission in case of data loss.
   - Interfaces directly with the **Network Layer**.

2. **Media Access Control (MAC)**:
   - Controls:
     - **Frame Addressing**: Uses unique MAC addresses for devices.
     - **Physical Medium Access**: Determines how devices share the transmission medium (e.g., CSMA/CD).
   - Ensures **collision management** and **efficient use** of shared media.

### **Functions of the Data Link Layer**
1. **Framing**:
   - Encapsulates network-layer packets into **frames**.
   - Adds **header** (with source/destination MAC addresses) and **trailer** (with error-checking codes like CRC).

2. **Addressing**:
   - Uses **MAC addresses** for unique identification of devices.
   - Enables **node-to-node delivery** by encapsulating source and destination physical addresses.

3. **Error Control**:
   - Detects and corrects transmission errors using techniques like:
     - **Parity bits**
     - **Checksums**
     - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**.
   - Handles **retransmission** of corrupted frames.

4. **Flow Control**:
   - Synchronizes data flow between sender and receiver to prevent buffer overflow.
   - Implements **stop-and-wait** or **sliding window protocols**.

5. **Access Control**:
   - Manages access to the shared communication channel.
   - Implements collision avoidance protocols like:
     - **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)** for wired networks.
     - **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)** for wireless networks.

### **Key Protocols in the Data Link Layer**
1. **Synchronous Data Link Protocol (SDLC)**:
   - Ensures synchronous communication between nodes.
2. **High-Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC)**:
   - Provides error-free communication through acknowledgment and retransmission.
3. **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)**:
   - Facilitates direct communication between two nodes.
4. **Link Access Procedure (LAP)**:
   - Used in ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network).
5. **Link Control Protocol (LCP)**:
   - Sets up and manages data link connections.

### **Additional Key Points (Less Known & Underrated)**
1. **Hidden Features of LLC**:
   - Implements **multiplexing identifiers (SAPs)**, which allow differentiation of protocols within the same network.

2. **MAC Sublayer Enhancements**:
   - Uses **Token Passing** in some network setups to prevent collisions (e.g., Token Ring networks).
   - Implements **802.1Q VLAN Tagging** for managing multiple VLANs on a single physical network.

3. **Error Control Techniques**:
   - **Hamming Code**: Detects and corrects single-bit errors.
   - **Reed-Solomon Codes**: Used in wireless and optical communication for burst error correction.

4. **Less Common Access Control Protocols**:
   - **ALOHA Protocol**:
     - Used in satellite and wireless communication.
     - Variants include **Pure ALOHA** and **Slotted ALOHA** for collision management.

5. **Advanced Framing Techniques**:
   - Implements **Flag Bytes** and **Byte Stuffing** to avoid misinterpretation of control characters within data.

6. **MAC Address Filtering**:
   - Allows network devices to filter incoming packets based on their MAC addresses, improving security.

7. **QoS (Quality of Service) Support**:
   - Provides prioritization of traffic in the Data Link Layer using **802.1p** standard for time-sensitive data (e.g., VoIP).

8. **Link Aggregation**:
   - Combines multiple physical links into one logical link for increased bandwidth and redundancy.

9. **Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE)**:
   - Introduced in **IEEE 802.3az**, reduces power consumption during low data activity periods.

10. **Error Detection vs. Error Correction**:
    - Some systems use **Forward Error Correction (FEC)** to reduce retransmissions.

11. **Virtual LAN (VLAN)**:
    - Implements logical segmentation of networks for improved performance and security.

12. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**:
    - Prevents loops in Ethernet networks by dynamically disabling redundant paths.

13. **Broadcast and Multicast Handling**:
    - DLL handles **broadcast storms** efficiently by filtering non-essential traffic.

14. **Frame Relay**:
    - A packet-switching technology using the Data Link Layer for WAN communications.

15. **MAC Address Spoofing Prevention**:
    - Implements security measures to detect and mitigate MAC address spoofing attacks.

16. **Backward Learning in Switches**:
    - Switches use **backward learning** to dynamically build MAC address tables for efficient packet forwarding.

17. **Redundancy Protocols**:
    - **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**: Provides backup for MAC address forwarding.

18. **Bit-Oriented Protocols**:
    - HDLC uses bit-oriented framing for compact and efficient communication.

19. **DLL and IoT**:
    - Specialized low-power protocols like **6LoWPAN** operate at the DLL for IoT applications.

20. **Integration with Wireless Standards**:
    - Works with **802.11 (Wi-Fi)** standards for robust and secure wireless communication.
