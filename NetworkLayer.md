**Network Layer (OSI Model)**

---

### **What is the Network Layer?**
The **Network Layer** is the **3rd layer** from the bottom and **5th layer** from the top in the OSI Model. This layer is pivotal for data transmission, ensuring data quality and enabling routing. It determines the best path for data transfer and manages logical addressing.

---

### **Functions of the Network Layer**
The Network Layer performs crucial roles in ensuring seamless data communication. Below are its core functions:

#### **1. Assigning Logical Addresses:**
- Assigns logical addresses (IP addresses) to devices for unique identification.
- Contains both source and destination IP addresses in each packet.
- IP address consists of **Host ID** and **Network ID**, ensuring sender and receiver authenticity.

#### **2. Routing:**
- Determines the best path for packet transmission using routing algorithms:
  - **Link-State Routing**
  - **Distance Vector Routing**
  - **Flooding**
  - **Random Walk**
- The header of each packet contains routing path information.

#### **3. Host-to-Host Delivery (Forwarding):**
- Transfers packets via routers, determining the best path.
- Forwards packets through multiple routers until they reach their destination.

#### **4. Logical Subnetting:**
- Divides larger networks into smaller sub-networks (subnets).
- Efficiently utilizes IP addresses and simplifies network management.

#### **5. Fragmentation and Reassembly:**
- Splits large packets exceeding the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) into smaller fragments.
- Reassembles fragments at the destination to reconstruct the original data.

#### **6. Error Handling:**
- Detects and corrects errors using methods like:
  - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
  - **Checksums**
  - **Hamming Code**, **Reed-Solomon Codes**, etc.
- Retransmits erroneous or lost packets based on ACK (Acknowledgment) and NACK (Negative Acknowledgment) signals.

#### **7. Quality of Service (QoS):**
- Prioritizes critical data for timely delivery.
- Reduces delay for high-priority traffic.

#### **8. Network Address Translation (NAT):**
- Converts private IP addresses to public IP addresses for communication.

#### **9. Congestion Control:**
- Manages network congestion using algorithms like:
  - **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**: Maintains a constant data flow rate.
  - **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Controls packet transmission based on available tokens.

#### **10. Encapsulation and Decapsulation:**
- Encapsulates data from the transport layer with headers containing source and destination IP addresses.
- Decapsulates data at the receiver end.

---

### **Working of the Network Layer**
- Receives data from the transport layer.
- Adds logical addresses (source and destination).
- Routes packets to the data-link layer for transmission over the network.
- Handles protocols and ensures secure delivery.

---

### **Responsibilities of the Network Layer**
1. **Routing:** Finds the fastest path for packet delivery.
2. **Packaging:** Prepares data for transmission.
3. **Traffic Management:** Handles network protocols to ensure smooth data flow.

---

### **Protocols Used at the Network Layer**
1. **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Core protocol for routing and addressing.
2. **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**: Secures IP communication through encryption.
3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Error reporting and diagnostic tool.
4. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)**: Manages multicast groups.
5. **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)**: Tunneling protocol for encapsulating packets.

---

### **Challenges in Network Layer Design**
1. **Routing Decisions:**
   - Static tables (predefined paths) or dynamic tables (adaptive paths).
   - Dynamic routing may cause performance issues during network congestion.
2. **Network Congestion:**
   - Excessive packets can overwhelm routers, causing delays or loss of critical data.
3. **Inter-Network Communication:**
   - Requires separate protocols for seamless interaction between networks.

---

### **Advantages of the Network Layer**
1. Efficiently divides data into smaller packets, ensuring reliable transmission.
2. Reduces congestion through routing and subnetting.
3. Enables reliable data transfer across multiple network nodes.

---

### **Disadvantages of the Network Layer**
1. Lack of flow control mechanisms.
2. Congestion during excessive data transmission may lead to packet loss.
3. Limited error correction mechanisms.

### **Comparison: Routing vs. Flooding**
| **Aspect**         | **Routing**               | **Flooding**            |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Routing Table**   | Required                 | Not required            |
| **Shortest Path**   | May or may not be used   | Always used             |

Here are detailed notes on **IP Addressing** along with explanations of **Subnetting** and **Supernetting**, tailored for competitive exams:

---

### **IP Addressing**

**Definition**:  
IP addressing is a system used to uniquely identify devices on a network. An IP address is a numerical label assigned to every device connected to a network, such as computers, smartphones, and IoT devices.

---

#### **Types of IP Addresses**
1. **IPv4**:
   - 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
   - Written in dotted-decimal notation (four octets separated by dots).
   - Total address space: \( 2^{32} \approx 4.29 \times 10^9 \) addresses.
   - Format: **Network ID + Host ID**.

2. **IPv6**:
   - 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
   - Written in hexadecimal and separated by colons.
   - Total address space: \( 2^{128} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38} \) addresses.
   - Introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4.

---

#### **Classes of IPv4 Addresses**
IP addresses are divided into five classes:

| **Class** | **Range**         | **Default Subnet Mask** | **Purpose**           |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| A         | 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0           | Large networks        |
| B         | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0       | Medium networks       |
| C         | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0     | Small networks        |
| D         | 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 | N/A               | Multicasting          |
| E         | 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 | N/A               | Experimental          |

---

### **Subnetting**

**Definition**:  
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks, or **subnets**. Each subnet operates as an independent network but remains part of the larger network.

**Purpose**:
1. Efficient IP address utilization.
2. Reduces network congestion by isolating traffic.
3. Enhances security by segmenting the network.

#### **Subnet Mask**:
- A subnet mask defines the boundary between the **network ID** and the **host ID** in an IP address.
- Example:  
  - IP: **192.168.1.0**
  - Subnet Mask: **255.255.255.0**
  - Network ID: **192.168.1.0**
  - Host Range: **192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254**
  - Broadcast Address: **192.168.1.255**

#### **Subnetting Formulae**:
1. **Number of Subnets**:  
   \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion.
   
2. **Number of Hosts per Subnet**:  
   \( 2^h - 2 \), where \( h \) is the number of bits remaining for the host portion (subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses).

#### **Example of Subnetting**:
- Given IP: **192.168.10.0/24**
- Borrow 3 bits for subnetting:
  - Subnet mask: **255.255.255.224 (/27)**.
  - Number of subnets: \( 2^3 = 8 \).
  - Hosts per subnet: \( 2^5 - 2 = 30 \).
- Subnets:
  - Subnet 1: **192.168.10.0 - 192.168.10.31**
  - Subnet 2: **192.168.10.32 - 192.168.10.63**
  - And so on.

---

### **Supernetting**

**Definition**:  
Supernetting is the process of combining multiple smaller networks into a single larger network. It is the opposite of subnetting.

**Purpose**:
1. To reduce the size of routing tables by aggregating routes (Route Summarization).
2. Used in **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)** to manage IP address space efficiently.

#### **Supernet Mask**:
- A supernet mask combines the network IDs of multiple contiguous subnets into a single range.
- Example:  
  - Networks: **192.168.0.0/24** and **192.168.1.0/24**.
  - Supernet Mask: **255.255.254.0 (/23)**.
  - Resulting Range: **192.168.0.0 - 192.168.1.255**.

---

### **Differences Between Subnetting and Supernetting**

| **Feature**       | **Subnetting**                            | **Supernetting**                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Divide a network into smaller subnets.    | Combine networks into a larger network.   |
| **Mask**          | Increases the subnet bits (smaller mask). | Decreases the network bits (larger mask). |
| **Application**   | Efficient IP usage within an organization.| Route aggregation in ISPs.                |
| **Methodology**   | Splitting.                                | Merging.                                  |

---

### **Key Concepts for Competitive Exams**
1. **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**:
   - Eliminates fixed class boundaries.
   - Represents addresses like **192.168.10.0/22**, where `/22` is the prefix length.

2. **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)**:
   - Allows subnets of different sizes within the same network.
   - Example: Dividing **192.168.1.0/24** into **/25**, **/26**, etc., based on needs.

3. **Private vs. Public IPs**:
   - **Private IPs**: Non-routable on the Internet (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x).
   - **Public IPs**: Routable on the Internet.

4. **Broadcast and Network Addresses**:
   - **Network Address**: First IP in a subnet (identifies the subnet).
   - **Broadcast Address**: Last IP in a subnet (used for broadcasting).

5. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
   - Maps private IPs to a public IP for Internet access.
   - Types: Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, PAT (Port Address Translation).

---

### **Underrated Points**
1. Subnetting reduces **broadcast domains**, improving performance in large networks.
2. Supernetting is crucial for hierarchical IP address assignment in ISPs.
3. Subnetting in IPv6 uses **prefix length** (e.g., `/64`), not subnet masks.
4. In CIDR, the route **192.168.0.0/22** aggregates **192.168.0.0 - 192.168.3.255**, saving routing table space.

---

### **Routing Algorithms: Distance Vector and Link State**

Routing algorithms determine the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination in a network. Two key algorithms used in routing are **Distance Vector Routing** and **Link State Routing**.

---

### **1. Distance Vector Routing Algorithm**

**Definition**:  
In the **Distance Vector** algorithm, each router maintains a table (vector) of minimum distances (or costs) to every other router in the network. These tables are periodically shared with neighboring routers, enabling routers to update their routes.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Distributed**: Routers exchange routing information only with their immediate neighbors.
2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: This algorithm underlies the distance vector routing process.
3. **Metric**: The metric is typically the number of hops or the cost assigned to links.

#### **Working**:
1. Each router initializes its routing table with direct neighbors' costs and infinite costs for others.
2. Routers periodically send their routing tables to neighbors.
3. Upon receiving neighbors' tables, routers update their own based on the formula:  
   \( D_{ij} = \min_k (C_{ik} + D_{kj}) \),  
   where \( D_{ij} \) is the cost from router \( i \) to router \( j \), \( C_{ik} \) is the cost from \( i \) to a neighbor \( k \), and \( D_{kj} \) is the cost from \( k \) to \( j \).

#### **Advantages**:
1. Simple and easy to implement.
2. Requires minimal computational resources.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. **Slow Convergence**: Can take time to adapt to network changes.
2. **Routing Loops**: May create loops during updates.
3. **Count-to-Infinity Problem**: Incorrect distance values can propagate indefinitely.

---

### **2. Link State Routing Algorithm**

**Definition**:  
In the **Link State** algorithm, each router builds a complete map of the network (link state database) and uses it to calculate the shortest paths to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Global Knowledge**: Routers gather information about the entire network topology.
2. **Database Exchange**: Routers share link state advertisements (LSAs) with all other routers.
3. **Metric**: The cost can be based on bandwidth, delay, or other factors.

#### **Working**:
1. **Neighbor Discovery**: Routers identify direct neighbors and measure the cost of links.
2. **Flooding**: Routers send LSAs to all other routers to share link costs.
3. **Database Formation**: Each router maintains a link state database representing the network.
4. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, routers compute the shortest path to all nodes.

#### **Advantages**:
1. Faster convergence.
2. No routing loops.
3. Scalability: Handles large and complex networks effectively.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. More computationally intensive due to Dijkstra’s algorithm.
2. Requires more memory for storing the topology database.
3. Higher bandwidth usage for flooding LSAs.

---

### **Differences Between Distance Vector and Link State**

| **Feature**               | **Distance Vector Routing**                     | **Link State Routing**                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge**              | Only direct neighbors’ routing information.    | Complete network topology.                    |
| **Algorithm**              | Bellman-Ford algorithm.                        | Dijkstra’s algorithm.                         |
| **Routing Table Updates**  | Periodically sent to neighbors.                | LSAs flooded to all routers.                  |
| **Convergence**            | Slower, prone to loops.                        | Faster, avoids loops.                         |
| **Memory Requirement**     | Low, stores limited information.               | High, stores the entire topology database.    |
| **Computational Overhead** | Low, simple computation.                       | High, requires shortest path calculation.     |
| **Example Protocols**      | RIP (Routing Information Protocol).            | OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), IS-IS.       |

---

### **Additional Notes**

#### **Routing Protocols Using Distance Vector**:
1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**:
   - Uses hop count as a metric.
   - Maximum hop count is 15, making it suitable for small networks.
   - Sends updates every 30 seconds.

2. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**:
   - Advanced distance vector protocol.
   - Combines features of distance vector and link state algorithms.

#### **Routing Protocols Using Link State**:
1. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**:
   - Divides networks into areas to reduce overhead.
   - Supports equal-cost multipath routing.

2. **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**:
   - Protocol for large, complex networks.
   - Similar to OSPF but operates in ISO networks.

---

### **Key Issues and Challenges**

1. **Count-to-Infinity Problem (Distance Vector)**:
   - Solution: Split horizon, poison reverse, and hold-down timers.

2. **Flooding Overhead (Link State)**:
   - Solution: Use hierarchical routing (e.g., areas in OSPF).

3. **Scalability**:
   - Distance vector struggles with large networks due to slower convergence.
   - Link state is preferred for large-scale networks but at the cost of resource usage.

4. **Hybrid Protocols**:
   - Combine the best of both algorithms (e.g., EIGRP).

---

### **Underrated Points for Competitive Exams**

1. **Triggered Updates (Distance Vector)**:
   - Reduces the frequency of updates by only sending changes.

2. **Sequence Numbers (Link State)**:
   - Ensures routers process LSAs in the correct order.

3. **Hierarchical Routing in Link State**:
   - Reduces complexity by grouping routers into regions (e.g., OSPF areas).

4. **Administrative Distance**:
   - Used to select the best path when multiple protocols are in use. RIP (120) vs OSPF (110).

### **ARP and RARP: Complete Notes**

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** and **Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)** are protocols used in networking to map different types of addresses used in a network. These protocols operate at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** and **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.

---

### **1. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

**Definition**:  
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map an IP address (Layer 3) to a physical MAC address (Layer 2) in a local area network (LAN).

#### **How ARP Works**:
1. **Request**:  
   - The source device sends a broadcast ARP request on the network, asking "Who has this IP address?"  
   - Example: *"Who has IP 192.168.1.5? Tell 192.168.1.1."*

2. **Reply**:  
   - The device with the requested IP address sends an ARP reply, providing its MAC address directly to the source device.  
   - Example: *"I am 192.168.1.5. My MAC address is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF."*

3. **Caching**:  
   - The source device caches the IP-to-MAC mapping in its **ARP table** for future use, avoiding repeated ARP requests.

#### **Key Features**:
- Operates only within a single broadcast domain (e.g., a LAN).
- ARP requests are broadcast to all devices in the network.
- ARP replies are unicast to the requesting device.

#### **ARP Table**:
- A table stored in memory that contains mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- The entries in the ARP table have a timeout value and are refreshed periodically.

#### **Types of ARP**:
1. **Proxy ARP**:  
   A router responds to ARP requests on behalf of another device, allowing communication across networks.
   
2. **Gratuitous ARP**:  
   A device broadcasts its own IP-to-MAC mapping, often used during device startup to detect IP conflicts.

3. **Reverse ARP (RARP)**:  
   Explained below.

#### **Limitations of ARP**:
1. Does not work across routers or subnets.
2. Vulnerable to ARP spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.

---

### **2. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)**

**Definition**:  
The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is used to map a MAC address (Layer 2) to an IP address (Layer 3). This is the reverse process of ARP and is used by diskless devices or systems during boot to request their IP address.

#### **How RARP Works**:
1. **Request**:  
   - A device broadcasts a RARP request containing its own MAC address, asking for its corresponding IP address.  
   - Example: *"I am AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. What is my IP address?"*

2. **Reply**:  
   - A RARP server, configured with a database of MAC-to-IP mappings, responds with the IP address for the requesting MAC address.  
   - Example: *"Your IP address is 192.168.1.10."*

#### **Key Features**:
- Primarily used by diskless devices or thin clients during booting.
- RARP requires a dedicated RARP server to maintain MAC-to-IP mappings.

#### **Limitations of RARP**:
1. Requires a central RARP server, which can be a single point of failure.
2. Does not support advanced configurations like subnet masks or gateways.
3. Has been largely replaced by **BOOTP** and **DHCP**, which offer more features and flexibility.

---

### **ARP vs. RARP**

| **Feature**         | **ARP**                                         | **RARP**                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Maps IP address to MAC address.                | Maps MAC address to IP address.                |
| **Direction**        | IP → MAC                                       | MAC → IP                                       |
| **Operation**        | Broadcast request, unicast reply.              | Broadcast request, unicast reply from RARP server. |
| **Usage**            | Used for normal LAN communication.             | Used by diskless systems during booting.       |
| **Dependency**       | No dependency on external servers.             | Requires a RARP server.                        |
| **Relevance Today**  | Still in use in most networks.                 | Mostly obsolete, replaced by BOOTP/DHCP.       |

---

### **Additional Notes**

#### **Security Concerns**:
1. **ARP Spoofing/Poisoning**:
   - Malicious devices can send forged ARP replies to associate their MAC address with another device's IP address.
   - This enables **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attacks or **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks.

   **Solution**: Use tools like ARP Watch or switch features like dynamic ARP inspection.

#### **Enhancements to ARP**:
1. **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**:
   - Used in IPv6 networks as a replacement for ARP.
   - Provides additional functionality like address autoconfiguration and router discovery.

#### **Protocols Replacing RARP**:
1. **BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)**:
   - Provides IP address and additional information like subnet mask and gateway.
   - Requires manual configuration of client information on the BOOTP server.

2. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:
   - Extends BOOTP by dynamically assigning IP addresses.
   - Supports lease mechanisms, reducing administrative overhead.

---

### **Key Points for Competitive Exams**

1. **ARP Packet Structure**:
   - Fields include Hardware Type, Protocol Type, Hardware Address Length, Protocol Address Length, Operation (Request/Reply), Sender MAC, Sender IP, Target MAC, Target IP.

2. **RARP Obsolescence**:
   - RARP is not used in modern networks due to its inability to handle complex network configurations.

3. **ARP Cache**:
   - ARP entries expire after a fixed time unless refreshed by new traffic.

4. **ARP in IPv6**:
   - ARP is replaced by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6 networks.

5. **Gratuitous ARP**:
   - Useful for detecting duplicate IP addresses during system startup.

---


### **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): Complete Notes**

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces the traditional **class-based addressing** (Class A, B, C). Introduced in 1993 by RFC 1517, CIDR optimizes IP address allocation and reduces waste, allowing for more efficient use of the limited IPv4 address space.

---

### **1. What is CIDR?**

- **Definition**:  
  CIDR is a flexible way of specifying IP address blocks by using a **prefix** to denote the network portion of the address.
  
- **Format**:  
  CIDR notation uses an **IP address** followed by a **slash (/)** and a **number** that specifies the number of bits in the network prefix.  
  Example: `192.168.0.0/24`  
  - `192.168.0.0` is the network address.  
  - `/24` indicates that the first 24 bits are the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are available for host addresses.

---

### **2. Comparison with Classful Addressing**

| **Aspect**           | **Classful Addressing**                  | **CIDR (Classless Addressing)**         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Address Classes**   | Uses fixed classes (A, B, C).            | Does not rely on fixed classes.         |
| **Network Prefix**    | Fixed prefix lengths (8, 16, 24 bits).   | Variable prefix lengths (1–32 bits).    |
| **Address Allocation**| Often leads to unused IPs (wastage).     | Minimizes wastage by allocating IPs based on actual need. |
| **Routing**           | More routing table entries (less efficient). | Aggregates routes, reducing table size (more efficient). |

---

### **3. CIDR Notation**

- **Structure**:  
  An IPv4 address in CIDR notation is written as `IP Address/Prefix Length`.  
  Example:  
  - `10.0.0.0/8`: Network prefix is the first 8 bits.  
  - `192.168.1.0/25`: Network prefix is the first 25 bits.  

- **Subnet Mask Representation**:  
  CIDR directly relates to subnet masks, but it simplifies notation.  
  - `/24` → Subnet mask `255.255.255.0`  
  - `/27` → Subnet mask `255.255.255.224`

---

### **4. Benefits of CIDR**

1. **Efficient Address Allocation**:  
   - Allocates IP addresses based on need, avoiding wastage typical of classful addressing.

2. **Aggregation of Routes (Route Summarization)**:  
   - CIDR allows multiple IP addresses to be grouped into a single **routing table entry**, reducing the size of routing tables.  
   - Example:  
     Instead of having routes for `192.168.0.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/24`, and `192.168.2.0/24`, CIDR can aggregate them as `192.168.0.0/22`.

3. **Support for Hierarchical Addressing**:  
   - ISPs can allocate address blocks to smaller networks and subnets flexibly, making hierarchical routing possible.

4. **Scalability**:  
   - Facilitates the growth of the Internet by extending the life of IPv4 and simplifying IPv6 deployment.

5. **Reduced Latency and Faster Routing**:  
   - Smaller routing tables mean faster lookup times, improving overall network performance.

6. **Backward Compatibility**:  
   - Compatible with existing IPv4 infrastructure and protocols.

### **5. CIDR Examples**

#### **Example 1: CIDR Block Allocation**  
- CIDR Block: `192.168.1.0/25`  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Network bits: 25  
  - Host bits: 32 - 25 = 7  
  - Number of hosts: \( 2^7 - 2 = 126 \) (excluding network and broadcast addresses)  
  - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.128`

#### **Example 2: Aggregated Route**  
- IPs: `192.168.0.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.2.0/24`, `192.168.3.0/24`  
- Aggregated as: `192.168.0.0/22`  
  - Network bits: 22  
  - Host bits: 32 - 22 = 10  
  - Number of hosts: \( 2^{10} - 2 = 1022 \)

### **6. Subnetting in CIDR**

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a CIDR block into smaller subnetworks. CIDR inherently supports flexible subnetting.  
- A `/16` block can be subdivided into smaller blocks like `/17`, `/18`, `/24`, etc.  
- Example:  
  Original Block: `10.0.0.0/16` → Subnet into `10.0.0.0/18`, `10.0.64.0/18`, and so on.

### **7. Drawbacks of CIDR**

1. **Complex Calculations**:  
   - Requires knowledge of binary math for subnet mask conversions and prefix length determination.

2. **Difficulty in Manual Configuration**:  
   - Can be challenging for network administrators to manually calculate and configure CIDR blocks.

3. **Limited Address Space (IPv4)**:  
   - While CIDR optimizes allocation, it cannot solve the fundamental shortage of IPv4 addresses.

---

### **8. CIDR in IPv6**

- In IPv6, CIDR is standard as IPv6 does not use classful addressing.  
- Example: `2001:0db8::/32`  
  - Network prefix is the first 32 bits.  
  - Simplifies routing in IPv6 networks by allowing hierarchical address allocation.

---

### **9. Key Points for Competitive Exams**

1. **CIDR Block Calculation**:  
   - Hosts per block: \( 2^{(32 - prefix\ length)} - 2 \).  
   - Example: `/26` → \( 2^{(32-26)} - 2 = 62 \) hosts.

2. **Aggregation Advantage**:  
   - CIDR minimizes the size of routing tables by allowing route aggregation.

3. **Subnet Mask Relation**:  
   - Subnet mask = A way to represent prefix length in decimal format.

4. **Relation to IPv6**:  
   - IPv6 uses CIDR exclusively for routing and allocation.
