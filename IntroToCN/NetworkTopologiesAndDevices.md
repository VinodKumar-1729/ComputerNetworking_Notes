# Network Topologies (Computer Networking)

## 1. Introduction to Network Topologies
Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. It defines how devices (nodes) are interconnected and communicate.

### Types of Network Topologies

#### 1. Bus Topology
- **Description**: All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus).
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to set up and extend.
  - Requires less cable compared to other topologies.
  - Cost-effective for small networks.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - A failure in the main cable stops the entire network.
  - Limited cable length and number of nodes.
  - Difficult to troubleshoot.
- **Applications**: Small office environments, LANs.

#### 2. Star Topology
- **Description**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to install and manage.
  - Failure of one device doesnâ€™t affect the rest of the network.
  - Easy to troubleshoot.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Central hub failure leads to network downtime.
  - Higher cost due to the hub and additional cabling.
- **Applications**: Home networks, small businesses.

#### 3. Ring Topology
- **Description**: Devices are connected in a circular pattern, with each device linked to two others.
- **Advantages**:
  - Data travels in one direction, reducing collisions.
  - Suitable for networks with predictable traffic.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Failure in one device or cable disrupts the network.
  - Difficult to troubleshoot.
- **Applications**: MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks).

#### 4. Mesh Topology
- **Description**: Each device is connected to every other device.
- **Advantages**:
  - High reliability due to multiple paths.
  - Fault tolerance and secure data transfer.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Expensive and complex to set up.
  - High cabling and maintenance costs.
- **Applications**: WANs, critical systems.

#### 5. Tree Topology
- **Description**: Combines multiple star topologies into a hierarchical structure.
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalable and easy to manage.
  - Isolates and manages smaller groups of devices.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Central hub failure affects the entire branch.
  - Complex configuration and maintenance.
- **Applications**: Large organizations.

#### 6. Hybrid Topology
- **Description**: Combination of two or more topologies.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible and scalable.
  - Can optimize network performance based on requirements.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex design and higher cost.
  - Difficult to troubleshoot.
- **Applications**: Large, complex networks.
